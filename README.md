Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting time series data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The dataset used is from Walmart, containing weekly sales information alongside key factors like holidays, temperature, fuel price, and unemployment rates. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, time series decomposition, and predictive modeling.

Key Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data.
Engineer meaningful features to enhance model performance.
Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
Implement forecasting models such as:
ARIMA/SARIMA for statistical forecasting.
Machine learning models for time-based predictions.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for deep learning forecasting.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Store: Store ID.
Date: Weekly sales date.
Weekly_Sales: Total sales for the week.
Holiday_Flag: Indicates if the week includes a holiday (1 for holiday, 0 otherwise).
Temperature: Average temperature for the week.
Fuel_Price: Weekly average fuel price in the region.
CPI: Consumer Price Index.
Unemployment: Unemployment rate in the region.
